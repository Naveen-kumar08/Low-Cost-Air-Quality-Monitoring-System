# Low-Cost Air Quality Monitoring System

This project is a **low-cost air quality monitoring system** that detects harmful gases and environmental conditions in real-time using multiple MQ sensors:

- **MQ-135** → Measures air quality 
- **MQ-2** → Detects LPG, smoke 
- **MQ-4** → Measures methane  
- **MQ-9** → Detects CO and combustible gases  

The system uses an **Arduino/ESP microcontroller**, shows readings on an **LCD display**, and triggers **LEDs or buzzer** alerts when pollution exceeds safe limits.

## Components

- Arduino / ESP microcontroller  
- MQ-135, MQ-2, MQ-4, MQ-9 sensors  
- DHT11 sensor (temperature & humidity)  
- LCD display  
- LEDs and buzzer

## How to Use

1. Connect the sensors to the microcontroller.  
2. Upload the Arduino/ESP code.  
3. Read gas levels on the LCD.  
4. LEDs/buzzer activate if unsafe levels detected.
